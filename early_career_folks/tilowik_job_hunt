## Things I learned or Wish I'd known before looking for that first engineering job.

Looking for that first engineer/developer role is HARD. The code school you went to
might not have stressed that in their promotional material... BUT IT IS HARD.

## First

Hiring in this industry is broken. It really is. It is very likely not you. You
have value and you are important no matter your job status. You will hit a point
where it might very well feel hopeless and impossible. You might very likely hit
that point a few times. Past that point somewhere is a job. 
Pretty sure I told my spouse through tears (and a snotty cry nose)
"I am doing this interview, and when I get rejected
for it, I am going to take a break and get a cat and be sad for a while." Then I
got the job.

* You can apply MULTIPLE times to the same company.

When you apply to one opening and don't hear back, this doesn not mean it was a 
"no, never". Unless you make it to interviews with a hiring manager and other folks,
it probably means you didn't have enough of something in the filter that
the recruiter used to process MANY MANY applications. No. You are not bothering
anyone if you apply again and again to different roles. There are people who's
job it is to read applications. It is better for companies to have too many applicants
than not enough.

I applied 2 or 3 times to the first place I worked before applying for the job
I would get.

* Job Requirement lists are aspirational

Remember making a list for Santa. Or how many things you put on your Etsy
wishlist vs. the number of things you actually buy? Those job requirement
lists are that. If the job looks interesting to you, and those requirements
are things you'd like to _be able to do_, and the add isn't for something that
says "staff/principal/lead/senior", apply away! 

Job ads for different roles are often just copied and pasted. People/teams don't
always have time to craft them to be tailored. If your cover letter or resume
sparks someone's interest, they might even consider someone at a different level
than what they were looking for.

* BTW Cover Letters

Yes. They are a pain to write. Yes. Sometimes people don't read them and don't
care. But sometimes people do read them and they can make the difference to
getting an interview with a hiring manager (often the first step after a quick recruiter chat)
and none. I no longer have the cover letter I wrote, but it is what got
me that first interview chat. He told me while I didn't have all the technical skills 
they were looking for yet, they appreciated my letter so much that they just had
to meet me. I was at that job for 4 years.

* Network

I am an antisocial butterfly. I met a really helpful developer advocate at a meetup.
He gave me the advice "Go to meetups. Make friends. Tweet". I told him, I was bad at/didn't
like any of those things. It is exactly how I found the job ad that resulted in my first job.

If you are a woman in tech, following other women in tech plus folks in the language communities
you are part of can be serendipitously helpful. Also VERY informational. People will share
job ads (companies give people recruiting bonuses for sharing job ad links), and people
will share places you might want to avoid (AKA RUN AWAY FROM). 

I met S. on twitter because he had worked where I did my internship (but years before). 
I connected with him at a community language meetup. He connected me with other folks.
He encouraged me to apply to a Ruby Conf scholarship. May everyone be as lucky to find
someone like S. when they are first starting.

L. tweeted her team was hiring. S saw her tweet and sent it to me. I laughed but applied
anyways even though I had applied there twice before. I tweeted at L. that I had applied.
She told her manager to look for my application. ... many interviews later ... Job.

In the post COVID-19 world, some of this might be different. But the general advice of trying
to make and build connections with folks applies.

* Network with Recruiters

Recruiters often get a bad wrap. Some of them definitely deserve it. But many are people
who legitimately like meeting with new people and trying to welcome them into the 
industry. Even if a recruiter doesn't have work they can set you up with, having a professional
or two who evaluate resumes/linkedIn and job applications as part of their job is super helfpul.
Many are happy to network and meet with you.

## Code Challenges

Here's a brain dump of tips from someone who evaluated code challenges for while.

* It should work. It should be understandable.

* Unless there is a timer enforced, the time suggested is _a suggestion_. Once people have
been coding for a while, or working in a language a long time, they can forget how long it might
take for someone to figure something out for the first time. 

* If you totally bomb it, it doesn't hurt to start over. If it's through something like
coderpad, let the recruiter know. They very well might allow you to do it again. Then share the 
lessons you learned in your README. Folks love it when people can show that they can learn.

* Write in the README how to run it. Please.

* Write what you would do next in your README if you had more time. If you are really stuck on
something or think something could be better if you had help -- you can say that too. Showing
you're aware and eager to learn is a plus.

* Sometimes what people ask for in code challenges is ridiculous and way to much, especially
since they are not paying you. Like I said, hiring in tech is broken. If they don't value
your time as an applicant -- they aren't going to value your time as an employee.

## Interviews

* Psst. This is a SECRET. The person interviewing you might be also nervous. I am always a bit
nervous when I interview folks -- It's because I don't want to mess up and negatively affect
someone else who is a in a nerve wracking situation. 

* Psst. This is also a SECRET. Some people just don't react much with facial expressions.
Especially over video chat. Their expression might very well not be about you. It doesn't
mean they aren't impressed/charmed etc.

* You can say you don't know something. That is cool. That shows maturity as a learner. Especially
when it's coupled with an enthusiastic, "let's look it up!" or "I don't know that...YET, but
it sounds interesting/cool/exciting"

* Psst. They are rooting for you. Interviewing takes a lot of time, but isn't folks main job. They've
probably got even more work to do than usual, since they need to hire another person. They legitimately
want to find someone to say yes to. They are not looking for people to say no to.

* You are also interviewing them. They also need to convince you that they are worthy of working with you.
Isn't that neat?
