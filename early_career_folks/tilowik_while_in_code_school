## TILOWIK While in Code School (First Draft)

Here are some things I wish I'd known or learned while in code school.

### First

Go, You! SERIOUSLY. It is a hard and brave thing to switch careers or start a new one.
You are learning so many new things and honestly the learning never stops. So start
practicing _not apologizing for not knowing_ things NOW. You where you are and that
is OKAY. Nobody should expect you to know all the things yet. Nobody should expect you
to know all the things in 5 years either. This field, the languages, tools, technologies,
companies, people, systems, architectures, best practices, etc, etc, will continue
to change and evolve at a steady pace. So it is okay not to know things, it is okay
to have to look something up, double check a doc, and ask questions at every level.
If it's not okay -- somebody is being an asshole and it's not you.

### The Things, in no particular order

*  I wish I'd paired with people who made me less comfortable.

We could often choose with whom we paired. So once I found a group of people that I was comfortable with, 
I stuck to that comfort zone.I avoided people I found intimidating (guys who already had 
programming experience and exudedtons of confidence), or annoying (the class mansplainer). 
I wish I had practice pairing with the people who intimidated me -- because pairing with folks who intimidate you is
really good workplace experience. Because impostor syndrome is real, and learning to work/think
through it is so.very.helpful.

You will also have to work with folks that are not going to treat you like you are
capable/intelligent. THIS SUCKS! It is unfair. It is crap that you have to do extra
emotional work. But until the patriarchal-white-supremicist-distopian-capitalist system is 
dismantled and rebuilt... This way you can practise strategies of setting boundaries, reframing,
giving difficult feedback, in a lower risk environment than the office.

* I wish I'd practiced typing more. 

Seriously. While I am now quite comfortable on the keyboard, I
definitely wasn't much of a touch typer when I started. Being a bit fluid on the keyboard
can really make a difference when you are interviewing. Typing Fright (think stage fright
for your fingers) sucks; being a better typist can help. My first mentor and manager
during my internship shared https://typing.io/ with me and it seriously helped me out.

* I wish I'd poked and played around more.

Go spelunking in your file system. Don't just read the docs for libraries (gems, packages,
frameworks), explore the source code a bit. Play around in the terminal (just CAREFUL what you `rm -rf`).
Try to enjoy the journey a little. Finishing the assignments is good, but I sometimes
focused too much on finishing each and every assignment quickly and not on exploration.

* I SO SO Wish I'd started looking at companies & their internship opportunities before finishing.

The code school I went to offered to set folks up with an internship. My turned out okay, I got 6 months
instead of 6 weeks. Some people in my cohort though got internships that were so unhelpful.
A few women in the class were so smart and started looking for their own opportunities
while we were still in class -- and they had jobs while we were still interning. Some Companies
that have internship programs also only offer them on a set calendar schedule.
You could finish your class and not make the application deadlines for places you'd like to work.
There is nothing to stop you from applying to things while you are still in codeschool.

* I Wish I'd Started networking more.

While the languages you are studying might differ from what you use when you start your first job,
a lot of the major languages have active communities (like Python or Ruby). Doing things to start participating
in one of those communities like meetups, or maybe twitter (can be a garbage fire), or open
source (can be a garbage fire), can give you opportunities to get the lay of the land,
learn about companies that hire folks in those languages, and maybe even meet a mentor or future
colleague or a helpful recruiter. 

Many conferences, I did this with RubyConf, offer scholarships to new folks especially if you
belong to a currently underepresented demographic in the tech industry. I did have to pay for
travel, but the ticket was free. Some conferences will also have funds to help with the
travel expenses too (although that isn't a thing in these pandemic times). I learned this
after the internship I did, but it could've been useful earlier.
