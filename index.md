## Welcome! I am happy you are here.

## What is this?

I have had a lot of conversations with code school grads/career switchers since I made the career
switch from teaching into software engineering and thought it was about time to start collecting all those tips/
resources etc. 

## CAVEATS APPLY

I hope you find some of these things useful. It is important to note that I am a cis/straight/white woman
and your mileage may vary on some of these things. It may be useful to know that I am also a
small-fat (still a lot of privelege there), very short, person that also handles anxiety & panic disorder.

## Who is the for?

Stuff in here might be useful if you have just left code school or an internship and are: 
* starting your careeras a software/web engineer/developer,
* an early career engineer looking for your next job,
* onboarding/mentoring a new engineer, 
* your job involves knowledge sharing,
* managing an earlier career engineer
